    <p>In 2002, as a sophomore in high school, I needed Oakley’s X-Metal Juliets. More specifically, I was hunting the
      Brushed Nickel frames with the Plasma lenses and spent all summer working to buy them. The euphoria I felt
      unboxing my pair was a sign of the times. Whether or not we realized it then, Oakley was (and is) embedded in
      countless core millennial cultural memories, and is an inseparable part of the era’s style identity. Michael
      Jordan and Dennis Rodman on a championship run. Brad Pitt in Fight Club; Wesley Snipes in Blade. Ato Boldon at the
      Sydney Olympics. The list goes on. And, back then, wearing a pair was a chance to feel some of that magic—to touch
      the same zeitgeist wave.</p>
    <p>Our Oakley fixation in the contemporary traces its roots directly back to that era, when wrap-around frames
      adorned with a rainbow of Iridium lenses and Oakley oval “O” logos etched into polished metals were both fixtures
      of the brand’s edgy designs. Today, those lines and model names are the stuff of fashion legend: Eye Jacket,
      X-Metal, Penny, and Over the Top only scratch the surface of the eyewear institution’s library.</p>
    <p>In those years, the absence of smartphones and social media meant less sharing and less visual noise, and that
      information isolation meant more stylistically defined subcultures. But even then, Oakley was unavoidable no
      matter what interests you gravitated towards. For years, it seemed like all of us, representing every
      group—skaters, ravers, runners, snowboarders, and rappers—were under the Oakley spell.</p>
    <p>Until we weren’t. From the late aughts to the mid-2010s, the brand seemed to disappear. </p>

    <p>“Oakley got so popular that it became uncool for a long time, because it was very ‘bro,’” reflects Kyle Ng,
      founder of lifestyle brand Brain Dead and head of Oakley Factory Team, the company’s experimental project that
      focuses on resurfacing and revamping choice archival items. “But through the dormant years, the brand was relooked
      at as having the most progressive designs out there. Now both subcultures and the mainstream love them.”</p>
    <p>With an identity so firmly pegged to the ‘90s and Y2K, it was inevitable for Oakley to reappear as part of the
      trend cycle. In the late 2010s, as Gen-Z discovered early aughts style and began unearthing Millennial relics,
      deadstock pairs of X-Metal Romeo, Juliet, and Mars frames started showing up on marketplaces with asking prices
      hundreds of dollars over their original MSRPs.</p>
    <p>The hype returned, ushered in by a generation too young to fully recall Oakley’s ‘90s conquest. And, as they
      showed off their rare finds and moodboards built from archival brand imagery, Millennials were also reminded of a
      brand that we collectively loved. </p>
    <p>After a long hiatus, Oakley was back, and its collaborations were flying off the racks. </p>
    <p>Fashion kids chased after the Vetements Spikes 400 frames and posted the Juergen Teller-shot Palace Thermonuclear
      Protection lookbook to their Instagram Stories. Travis Scott became an avid collector. Balenciaga flipped the
      logo. Then, NBA All-Star Jaylen Brown announced a new brand deal.</p>

    <p>“Beyond its legacy of boundary-pushing designs, disruptive nature, and futurist visions—which align perfectly
      with some of my core brand values—Oakley’s collaborative commitment to advancing sports, uplifting culture, and
      aiding the community are a few key reasons that drove my interest in the partnership,” noted Brown.</p>
    <p>Brown’s partnership announcement came in February, leading up to Oakley’s 50th anniversary this July. As the
      milestone approaches, Oakley has been reflecting on the influence of its revolutionary designs from decades past,
      while committing itself to introducing new pieces that ambitiously seek to represent the design and cultural
      innovation of the next 50 years. Choice examples include the angular Plantaris eyewear silhouette and the
      futuristic Latitude apparel collection.</p>
    <p>“The past should inspire the future; it shouldn’t repeat it. What you will start to see as we move forward is a
      strong evolution of the language,” remarks Brian Takumi, VP of Brand Soul, whose role is to ensure Oakley retains
      its brand DNA.</p>

    <p>As Oakley charts its path from now through 2075, it’s clear the brand isn’t trying to distance itself from the
      past. The team is proud of releases like Trenchcoat, E Wire, and Half-X, but they’re also reminding themselves
      that there’s more work to be done, more adaptation to be embraced.</p>
    <p>“If you always do what you’ve always done, you always get what you always got. We need to constantly be forcing
      ourselves to look at what’s next,” says Takumi. “A good example would be the Jacket family of eyewear. When you
      look at Plantaris, it takes some of that silhouette and evolves it with more future-forward design language. It’s
      not a complete departure. You can start seeing how we build off our past and look to the future.”</p>

    <h2>OUT OF THE ARCHIVES: KYLE NG & OAKLEY FACTORY TEAM</h2>
    <p>Kyle is the co-founder and creative director of Brain Dead and heads up Oakley Factory Team, an ongoing
      collaborative project that reinterprets iconic Oakley models for the present.</p>

    <p>You’re a subcultures guy. What’s your perspective on Oakley’s role within ‘90s and early ‘00s subcultures?
      Oakley’s design language has resonated with so many subcultures, from sports to the avant-garde. The futuristic
      functional design has inspired all types of creatives for years. Oakley just did what they wanted. During the
      ‘90s, postmodernism was the wave, allowing people to be playful with design language. Oakley was a child of that.
    </p>

    <p><span class="uppercase">How did Factory Team come about?</span><br />I’m a collector of Oakley, and I grew up
      with it. But I also love sports and design, and inherently, the brand
      speaks to me. The Factory Team project came about by my love and collection of Oakley vintage footwear.

    <p><span class="uppercase">Can you describe what Oakley Factory Team is and its guiding principles?</span><br />
      Oakley Factory Team is a puzzle piece within the whole body of our work. We’re huge fans of Oakley, so Factory
      Team is a way for us to tell stories inspired by its past, present, and future, as well as express our perspective
      of the legendary brand. We are so inspired by the futuristic design of what Oakley has created, and we believe
      that even the heritage models are lightyears ahead of their time. We want to explore the Oakley design language
      even deeper.</p>
    <p><span class="uppercase">What is the process like building a collection from archival pieces? What are you looking
        for when you select
        each piece? Do you have a personal favorite?</span><br />
      Products should physically make you feel a certain way when you see them. They need to be desirable and not overly
      considered. It’s an emotional reaction, not a psychological one. I chose the styles that really interested me, and
      tweaked them to fit with what we felt would make them work in today’s world. The IBEX is very special to me
      because it’s the shoe we designed from scratch. It is a representation of where Oakley can go.</p>

    <p><span class="uppercase">What goal do you hope to reach through the project’s lifespan?</span><br />
      We have no end game. As long as there are stories to be told with the project, we’re excited to work on it!</p>

    <h2>FUNCTION WITH EDGE: BRICE PARTOUCHE OF SATISFY</h2>
    <p class="uppercase">Brice is the founder and creative director of SATISFY, a running brand that looks to redefine
      the historically
      performance-oriented sport by introducing new cultural perspectives to it.</p>

    <p><span class="uppercase">Can you remember the first Oakley product that caught your eye?</span><br />
      I came from skateboarding, snowboarding, fashion, and music. Those worlds shaped my approach to creativity. Oakley
      was everywhere when I was growing up, but the first time it really caught my eye was on the slopes. As a kid, I
      remember seeing someone wearing the Eye Jacket while snowboarding, and it just looked different — futuristic,
      almost alien. It wasn’t just another piece of equipment; it felt like something from another world.</p>

    <p>
      <spam class="uppercase">Tell us about the SATISFY customer. Do you get the impression they had a similar
        relationship to Oakley that you
        did?</spam><br />
      SATISFY attracts a different kind of runner. Not just the purists chasing times, but people who see running as
      part of a bigger picture, something that connects to music, fashion, and subculture. They’re from all over —
      Tokyo, LA, Paris, New York — but their mindset unites them. They care about design, performance, and storytelling.
      Many of them grew up in the same world I did and in that world, Oakley wasn’t just sportswear; it was a symbol of
      pushing things forward.

  <section class="text-section">
    <p><span class="uppercase">What about Oakley in the present makes it a fit for the SATISFY brand?</span><br />
      We approach SATISFY like a music label or a skateboard brand, bringing a DIY energy and community-based approach.
      We
      work with the best materials, obsess over every detail, and never compromise on design. The goal is to create gear
      that doesn’t just perform, but also resonates with people beyond running. Everything we do is rooted in technical
      innovation, but it also has to feel effortless.</p>

    <p>Oakley gets that balance. They’re constantly evolving, rethinking materials, pushing the limits of optics and
      form.
      That kind of relentless pursuit of innovation is what makes them such a strong partner for us. So when we
      collaborate with Oakley, it feels natural, like bridging two things that were always meant to intersect.</p>

    <p><span class="uppercase">How do you approach the product selection and design of your Oakley collaborations with
        both performance and fashion factors in mind?</span><br />
      When we select products, we think about what a runner actually needs, but we also think about silhouettes,
      materials, and how the piece lives beyond the run. The eyewear has to shield you from glare, feel weightless, and
      stay put. But it should also look like something you’d wear all day, not just while training. That’s how we
      approach
      every decision — through the lens of function and feeling.</p>

    <p>Your most recent collaboration featured the Oakley Plantaris frames. Tell me about them.<br />
      Oakley has decades of experience in optics and material innovation, things we wouldn’t be able to develop at the
      same scale. Good running eyewear should disappear when you wear it. It shouldn’t bounce, fog up, or distort your
      vision. The Plantaris nails that. It’s ultra-light, wraps perfectly to the face, and the optics are crystal clear
      in
      different light conditions. </p>

    <p>But beyond function, it has an edge. It looks different. Not just another pair of sporty wraparounds, but
      something
      with attitude. That balance is why we chose it. It’s pure Oakley, but it also feels unmistakably SATISFY. </p>

    <p>What do you hope your customers are discovering through each of the collaborative drops?<br />
      Every drop is an opportunity to rethink what performance looks like. It’s not about following the same formulas.
      It’s about giving people gear that enhances their experience while staying true to who they are. If a runner puts
      on
      a pair of our Oakleys and feels faster, freer, or more like themselves, we’ve done our job.</p>

    <h2>Innovation in Focus:<br />NicK Garfias</h2>
    <p class="font-roboto font-bold">Nick is Oakley’s VP of design. Since 2011, he’s been translating Oakley’s iconic
      brand language into its next
      generation of eyewear and lifestyle pieces.</p>

    <p><span class="uppercase">How would you describe Oakley’s design philosophy and aesthetic?</span><br />
      I think about philosophy, yes, but I would never begin with just aesthetics. If we are doing it correctly, we are
      considering all aspects—function, emotion,z and aesthetics. Did I mention the fourth aspect? Not following the
      rules.</p>

    <p><span class="uppercase">But, when I think about design philosophies throughout time that resonate with Oakley,
        most of them stem from a
        functional need and the enhancement of human performance—i.e. what is the problem that we need to
        solve?</span><br />
      Great designs center on functionality—solving the problem at hand for the wearer. Only then do we move on to
      aesthetics. That said, aesthetics are a huge part of the process because they do play a part in the psychosomatics
      of performance. Our designs help athletes perform, but they also have to look like they do, meaning they can’t
      just
      be fast, they have to look fast, too.</p>

    <p><span class="uppercase">How do you tap into the power of Oakley’s existing design identity without getting stuck
        in it? </span><br />
      We’re not here to recreate the past because that’s not how you build a future. To look back at what we did in the
      ‘90s and recite old models is stagnation. However, using the ethos and the lineage from the past as a guide to
      evolve our future will always include those recognizable DNA strands. </p>

    <p><span class="uppercase">What are some of the most important aspects of Oakley’s design language that you want to
        carry
        forward? </span><br />
      I think we’ll always be focused on innovation. If we go back to the aspects that represent our design philosophy,
      innovation has to be at the very top when considering our focus for the future. New materials and engineering are
      the result. Style is a bad word in our vocabulary. Charles Eames said, “The extent to which you have a design
      style
      is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem.” </p>

    <p><span class="uppercase">From your position within the company, and as a fan of the brand, what is Oakley’s place
        within the cultural
        landscape today, and where do you want to take it from here? </span><br />
      At one time we may have pigeonholed ourselves into a singular consumer. We’ve changed our perspective and—with
      some
      self realization as a brand—we’ve become better listeners. We’ll always be innovation leaders, but now that’s
      accompanied by an approach that focuses more on individual consumers, rather than our own assumptions. </p>

    <p><span class="uppercase">What role do collaborations play in furthering Oakley’s brand identity and design language? </span><br />
    Collaborations are extremely important for us. But we have to be very selective about the brands we partner with. It
    needs to be a steady balance and a very meaningful, relevant connection. I personally enjoy partnerships with brands
    that have opinions about design and experience with the design process. Then, it is truly a collaborative effort at
    the highest level of creativity. </p>

    <p><span class="uppercase">What are your hopes for the brand in the future, whether it’s product innovation, a dream brand you want to
    collaborate with, or a design you want to re-introduce? </span><br />
    We have a lot of projects that have never seen the light of day. Brilliant solutions and elegant executions, but
    they’re just not ready for the world yet. I would love to see these great ideas come to fruition before relaunching
    something we’ve already done.</p>
