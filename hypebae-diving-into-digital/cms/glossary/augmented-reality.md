f_key-word: Augmented Reality
f_glossary-description: >-
  Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that merges digital components with the
  physical world. It uses advanced sensors to detect objects, people, and
  environmental scenes. It can then display digital elements that interact with
  these physical elements. AR can create entirely new experiences and has the
  potential to revolutionize how we interact with the world.
