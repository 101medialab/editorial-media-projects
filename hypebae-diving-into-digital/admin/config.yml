              3D creation, which is how he started the @scccccry Instagram
              account. The intricate part of it is then translating a virtual
              sample into the IRL, finding the right material and making sure
              it's wearable. 3D printing allows endless possibilities for
              making, but most of the time it's just a tool for creating
              prototypes, not wearable designs. And four years later, this is
              where we are now, really trying to create a seamless system of
              production, from URL to IRL. We are also really conscious of
              minimizing our carbon footprint, which is why we incorporate
              sustainability into the very core of our designs. We believe that
              innovation not only lies in a designer's creative expression but
              also in eco-conscious practices., key: 7c9619da

              connected to a body, allowing us to have different identities at
              the same time. I also think what's freeing is being able to belong
              to different virtual communities and change our avatar identity

              exaggerations that can be created digitally really interest me.
              For example, super exaggerated, sometimes physically
              impossible-looking nails and clothes, prosthetics that make models
              look less "human," or even just casting people with unconventional
              features, which has been more prevalent in the fashion industry
              over the last few years. I also think that IRL events in the
              fashion industry have become more like performances or "immersive
              experiences," rather than just simple showcases of clothes,
              accessories, or beauty products. Brands are trying to engage
              audiences used to constant immersion in the never-ending scroll of
              online content available. By making audiences feel like they are
              not just consumers but rather part of a "community," these
              immersive showcases are trying to translate how people feel
              connected when participating in digital culture to a real-life
              space and industry., key: -5020c0f9

              post-internet movement was in the ‘00s. As the internet grew ever
              more intertwined with people's lives, the IRL started to interpret
              the internet as part of an art and aesthetics movement that
              reflected the visual cacophony of the early web. Post-internet
              artists would create physical works that imitated pixels, glitches
              and 3D graphics of the first computers. I think these new
              popularized trends are just revised versions of the glitch core,
              seapunk and vaporwave aesthetics that littered our Tumblr pages in
              the early ‘10s; versions that reflect the updated and
              ever-evolving present graphics of our many screens., key: 259c0761

              year won't be used as much anymore as it doesn't really mean
              anything. In its best version, you can see how it is trying to
              manifest an idea. But the problem with the metaverse world is that
              it relies on very small insights and unpopular crypto platforms.
              The most interesting thing about the metaverse is that it's in an
              open economy, an alternate reality powered by an alternate
              currency. You can see how this is changing how we think of a
              product or a brand and how we think of different business models
              and ways of creating experiences that are not necessarily
              physical. You can still have commerce and interactions through

              Original text: I have always been a big video game head and loved
              spending a lot of time in character creation schemes. I’ve always
              been fascinated by how, in most games, you have different
              accounts, different types of characters, all of that. You see a
              lot of female characters played by guys and many male characters
              played by females. When you have the option of non-human avatars,
              you immediately experiment with it. In gaming chats, most people
              know each other by the characters they use and not by what they
              look like in real life. It opens up many possibilities to express
              yourself without being read by what you look like. It's something
              that's been on the internet for a while, where you can be behind
              the profile picture and no one knows who you are, which I think is
              good because a lot of people have anxieties because of their
              bodies. I believe avatars can help ease these anxieties by
              creating new types of relationships between people., key:

              audiences on that; to understand the core benefits of the Web3
              space. I think it's quite easy because the moment you experience
              it for the first time, such as buying a digital good, it opens
              many doors. It becomes very natural to understand why it's cool
              and why it's the future. The problem is, in Web3, there are a lot
              of bad experiences; there's a high entry price now and the good
              stuff is often more expensive. We need big players to make
              something accessible enough to their existing audience and then,
              it will be hard for them to go back to just buying physical stuff,
              trying to resell it, or having it on their shelves where no one
              sees it. With virtual collectibles, you can easily showcase them
